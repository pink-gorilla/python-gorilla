;;; # Data science intro with panthera
;;; ## Clojure + Pandas + Numpy = ðŸ’–
;;; 
;;; I'll show how it is possible to get the most out of the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) & the Clojure ecosystem at the same time.
;;; 
;;; This intro is based on this [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/kanncaa1/data-sciencetutorial-for-beginners) you can follow along with that if you come from the Python world.
;;; 
;;; ## Env setup
;;; 
;;; The easiest way to go is the provided [Docker image](https://cloud.docker.com/u/alanmarazzi/repository/docker/alanmarazzi/panthera), but if you want to setup your machine just follow along.
;;; 
;;; ### System install
;;; 
;;; If you want to install everything at the system level you should do something equivalent to what we do below:
;;; 
;;; ```bash
;;; sudo apt-get update
;;; sudo apt-get install libpython3.6-dev
;;; pip3 install numpy pandas
;;; ```
;;; 
;;; ### conda
;;; 
;;; To work within a conda environment just create a new one with:
;;; 
;;; ```bash
;;; conda create -n panthera python=3.6 numpy pandas
;;; conda activate panthera
;;; ```
;;; Than start your REPL from the activated conda environment. This is the best way to install requirements for panthera because in the process you get MKL as well with Numpy.
;;; 
;;; ### Here
;;; 
;;; Let's just add panthera to our classpath and we're good to go!

;;; We can read data into panthera from various formats, one of the most used is `read-csv`. Most panthera functions accept either a data-frame and/or a series as a first argument, one or more required arguments and then a map of options.
;;; 
;;; To see which options are available you can check docs or even original [Pandas docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html#pandas.read_csv), just remember that if you pass keywords they'll be converted to Python automatically (for example `:index-col` becomes `index_col`), while if you pass strings you have to use its original name.
;;; 
;;; Below as an example we `read-csv` our file, but we want to get only the first 10 rows, so we pass a map to the function like `{:nrows 10}`.

;;; Let's look at the operation above:
;;; 
;;; - `subset-cols`: we use this to, well, subset columns. We can choose N columns by label, we will get a 'new' data-frame with only the selected columns
;;; - `melt`: this transforms the data-frame from wide to long format (for more info about it see [further below](#reshape)
;;; - `->clj`: this turns data-frames and serieses to a Clojure vector of maps
;;; 
;;; `subset-cols` is pretty straightforward:

;;; 
;;; Some of the most common operations with rectangular data is to reshape them how we most please to make other operations easier.

;;; The R people perfectly know what I mean when I talk about [tidy data](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10/v59i10.pdf), if you have no idea about this check the link, but the main point is that while most are used to work with double entry matrices (like the one above built with `describe`), it is much easier to work with *long data*: one row per observation and one column per variable.
